#### Finer Points of the three building blocks

## Describe 
> All the different variations on describe amount to the same thing: you say what it is you are testing. 

> The description can be a string, or any Ruby class, module or object. You can combine these two approaches and pass in a Ruby class/module/object followed by a string.

> Differences may seem subtle but passing a class name has some advantages. It first requires the class to exist and be spelled correctly.
